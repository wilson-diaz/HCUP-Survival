# HCUP-Survival

Final project for my Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Course. Focus is on survival analysis of atrial fibrillation patients with regard to development of certain complications, specifically stroke, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy. I implement the Python lifelines survival analysis library and DeepSurv. Also included are the scripts I wrote to preprocess the data into the proper format.

## About HCUP
